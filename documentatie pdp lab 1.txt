Problem statement:
	Supermarket inventory:
There are several types of products, each having a known, constant, unit price. In the begining, we know the quantity of each product.

We must keep track of the quantity of each product, the amount of money (initially zero), and the list of bills, corresponding to sales.
Each bill is a list of items and quantities sold in a single operation, and their total price.

We have sale operations running concurrently, on several threads. Each sale decreases the amounts of available products (corresponding to
the sold items), increases the amount of money, and adds a bill to a record of all sales.

From time to time, as well as at the end, an inventory check operation shall be run. It shall check that all the sold products and all the
money are justified by the recorded bills.

Program Description:
	A fixed number of threads are trying to buy a fixed/random number of differrent products and differrent quantities. At time shall be 
some verification made to see if the number of products buyed are maching with the products extracted from the inventory. Also a final check
needs to be made in order to see if the balance is corect.



Tests:
	First run of the tests:
		First test:
			-number of products: 101
			-number of threads: 10
			-time for performing: 0.064
			
		Second test:
			-number of products: 1001
			-number of threads: 90
			-time for performing: 0.128

		Third test:
			-number of products: 10001
			-number of threads: 900
			-time for performing: 1.216
			
	Second run of the tests:
		First test:
			-number of products: 101
			-number of threads: 10
			-time for performing: 0.032
			
		Second test:
			-number of products: 1001
			-number of threads: 90
			-time for performing: 0.16

		Third test:
			-number of products: 10001
			-number of threads: 900
			-time for performing: 1.184

After the second run of the test we can see that the time results are almost consistent.
As we can see the differrence from 10 threads to 90 threads is almost insesisable, but the real difference of 1 second is beetween 
90 and 900.
