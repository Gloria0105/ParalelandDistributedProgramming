Lab 6 - Parallelizing techniques

1. Goal
    The goal of this lab is to implement a simple but non-trivial parallel algorithm.

2. Requirement
        Given a directed graph, find a Hamiltonian cycle, if one exists. Use multiple
    threads to parallelize the search.

3. Computer Specification
• CPU: Intel Core i7-0750H, 2.60GHz
• RAM: 16 GB
• System type: 64-bit

4. Short Description of the Implementation
    Algorithm - Backtracking:
    • generate all possible paths starting from eah node, and check each one if it is a
    Hamiltonian cycle.
    • in parallelized version we have one thread executing the backtrack for one node
    Parallelization - Used the Thread class along with the ArrayBlockingQueue


5. Performance Tests
    regular linear alg:
        Level 1 : 2ms
        Level 50 : 82ms
        Level 100 : 400ms

    parallelized  alg:
            Level 1 : 0ms
            Level 50 : 35ms
            Level 100 : 100ms



6. Conclusion
    Parallelization is the best method when using backtracking.
    It is almost 3 times faster.
